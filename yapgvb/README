Quick installation: 

Linux:

    1. make sure that boost.python and graphviz are installed.  
       graphviz must be >= version 2.6, and should be compiled as 
       dynamically linked libraries.
    
    2. optionally install the boost.graph python bindings.
    
    3. edit config.py to match your system

    4. run 'python setup.py build'

    5. if that works, run 'python setup.py install'


Windows:

    1. Install graphviz.  
    
    2. Build boost.   
        I. Download and extract the .zip archive for boost_1_33_1 (or better)
        II.     Download the bjam binary for windows.  
        III.    Edit your PATH so that bjam is in it.  
        IV.   Open a cmd shell.
        V.   Make sure that your Visual Studio .NET 2003* environment is set up.
               This can usually be accomplished by running the vcvars32.bat script
               that comes with Visual Studio.
        VI.     chdir to the boost_1_33_1 directory
        VII.    Type 'bjam'

    3. Edit yapgvb/config_win32.py to match your setup
    
    4. From the command line, run:
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install
        
        (or python setup.py bdist_wininst to build an installer)

* afaik, Visual Studio .NET 2003 is the only version of visual studio that can be used
to build extensions for the stock distribution of Python 2.4 without modification.
The free compiler suite /can/ be used, but requires some kind of ugly hack to distutils.
Search the web/usenet for more info (in particular, search on comp.lang.python)
